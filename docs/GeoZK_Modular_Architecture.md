# üìÑ GeoZK - Modular Architecture & Future Versions

This document outlines the motivation and future modular versions of the GeoZK project beyond the core MVP. Each version is designed with flexibility, real-world applicability, and privacy-performance trade-offs in mind.

---

## üéØ Project Motivation & Strategic Focus

1. **Study Existing Systems**

   * Evaluate protocols like ZKLP, zkMaps, zkLocation, and zkAttend.
   * Analyze performance, accuracy, privacy trade-offs, and user adoption.

2. **Design Modular Architecture**

   * Allow pluggable granularity (e.g., grid/city-level).
   * Support multiple deployment types: centralized or decentralized.
   * Make proof systems interchangeable: SNARK, STARK, floating-point, etc.

3. **Prototype Real-Use Scenarios**

   * **Attendance Tracking**: ZK-enabled geofencing for event entry or school check-ins.
   * **LBS Verification**: Proof of presence near retail outlets without location exposure.
   * **Compliance Use-Cases**: Proofs for location-based subsidies or policy enforcement.

4. **Developer Adoption & Community Growth**

   * Provide SDKs, APIs, integration templates.
   * Maintain comprehensive docs, guides, and open issues.
   * Attract contributors and build public trust through clarity and engagement.

## üß© Core Axes of Modularity

1. **Location Granularity**

   * GPS coordinates (high precision)
   * Hex Grid (mid-level privacy)
   * City/Region-level (high privacy)

2. **Deployment Mode**

   * Centralized verification (server-based)
   * Decentralized smart contract (zkEVM or L2 chains)

3. **Proof Type**

   * SNARK (Groth16)
   * STARK (Cairo/StarkNet)
   * Floating-point SNARK (IEEE-754)
   * Bulletproofs (optional)

4. **Location Source**

   * Device GPS
   * WiFi / Bluetooth signals
   * Trusted beacons / triangulation

5. **Attestation Strength**

   * Browser-based geolocation
   * OS or hardware-level attestation
   * Multi-source or fused attestation

6. **Verifier Type**

   * Smart contract verifier (on-chain)
   * API verifier (backend services)
   * SDK-integrated app verifier

   * Sensor fusion with hardware signal
   * Use cases: fleet tracking, asset location

4. **GeoZK-Float**

   * Floating-point ZK proof circuits (IEEE-754 compliant)
   * Research-oriented, high precision, low leakage

5. **GeoZK-Chain**

   * Fully on-chain verifier
   * zkEVM or StarkNet contract deployment
   * Open for public verification

6. **GeoZK-SDK**

   * Modular developer toolkit
   * Proof generation and verification library
   * Easy mobile/web integration

7. **GeoZK-Pro**

   * Enterprise/Gov grade
   * Includes policy enforcement, access control
   * GDPR-compliant audit trails

## üîç Gap Analysis: How GeoZK Could Stand Out

| Feature Area              | What‚Äôs Missing in Others                               | How GeoZK Could Excel                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision vs. Privacy** | Integer grids or overly-detailed floating point proofs | Adaptive hex-grid granularity per use case (e.g., neighborhood vs. street)   |
| **Real-World Deployment** | Most projects are academic PoCs                        | Focus on scalable, production-grade use (e.g., LBS, attendance, compliance)  |
| **Spoofing Resistance**   | Browser geolocation (easily faked)                     | Use hardware attestation and signal fusion for real-world robustness         |
| **Interoperability**      | Poor integration with standards or APIs                | Provide well-documented SDKs and REST/gRPC APIs for mobile/web integration   |
| **Tooling & Docs**        | Limited docs and dev adoption                          | Build strong tutorials, maintain GitHub issues, focus on DX (Dev Experience) |
