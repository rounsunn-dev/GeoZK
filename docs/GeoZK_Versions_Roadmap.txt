# ðŸ“„ GeoZK - Modular Versions Roadmap

This document outlines future versions of the GeoZK project beyond the core MVP. Each version focuses on extensibility, privacy-performance trade-offs, and real-world adoption for different environments.

---

## ðŸ”§ Core Axes of Modularity

1. **Location Granularity**

   * Fine: GPS coordinates (Â±5m)
   * Medium: Hex Grid (e.g., H3)
   * Coarse: City-level / region-level

2. **Deployment Mode**

   * Centralized: GeoZK backend verifies proof
   * Decentralized: Smart contract (ZK-rollup compatible)

3. **Proof Type**

   * SNARK (e.g., Groth16 via Circom)
   * STARK (e.g., Cairo/StarkNet)
   * Floating-point SNARKs (IEEE-754 compliant)
   * Bulletproofs (optional)

4. **Location Source**

   * Device GPS
   * Wi-Fi / Bluetooth
   * Hardware beacons
   * Sensor fusion / multiple attestation sources

5. **Attestation Strength**

   * Browser-based
   * OS/hardware-based attestation
   * Third-party verified beacon/sensor

6. **Verifier Type**

   * Smart contract (EVM, StarkNet, ZK-rollups)
   * API backend
   * Client SDK

## ðŸ“¦ Future Versions of GeoZK

1. **GeoZK-Core (âœ… MVP Focus)**

   * SNARK-based
   * Hex-grid based region proof
   * Centralized backend verifier (Node.js)
   * Command-line + basic web UI

2. **GeoZK-Lite**

   * Purely client-side
   * Browser location API
   * Lower proof strength, fast generation
   * Demo use-cases like attendance check-in

3. **GeoZK-Edge**

   * Designed for IoT/edge devices
   * Hardware-anchored attestation (e.g., GPS chip + Wi-Fi signal)
   * Applications: vehicle, warehouse, delivery tracking

4. **GeoZK-Float**

   * High-precision, floating-point based proof circuits (IEEE-754)
   * Custom grid boundary selection
   * Academic/research optimized version

5. **GeoZK-Chain**

   * Fully decentralized
   * Smart contract verifier deployed on zkEVM or StarkNet
   * Trusted setup avoided (via STARK)

6. **GeoZK-SDK**

   * Modular proof-generation and verification SDK
   * Easy integration into mobile/web apps
   * Backend or frontend support

7. **GeoZK-Pro**

   * Enterprise/government-grade
   * Policy-based access, privacy control
   * Auditable proofs with regulatory compliance

ðŸš§ Note:
This roadmap is for modular evolution after the MVP is stable. Each version will have benchmarks to guide tradeoffs between privacy, speed, and usability.
